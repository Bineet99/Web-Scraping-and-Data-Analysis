## **Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis**

This project demonstrates how to extract real-time news headlines from the *Hindustan Times* website, analyze their sentiment, and visualize the results using Python. The script uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the latest headlines from the India News section. These headlines are then analyzed using the `TextBlob` library to determine their sentiment polarity — categorized as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

The results are stored in a **Pandas DataFrame**, saved to a CSV file, and visualized using a **bar chart** generated by `matplotlib`. The visualization provides a quick overview of the tone of the current news cycle, using green, red, and gray to represent sentiment categories.

This task was developed using **Visual Studio Code**, but can also be run on Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or other Python environments. It integrates key skills such as web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization — making it ideal for real-time news monitoring, public sentiment analysis, or educational purposes.

In practical scenarios, this project could be expanded to monitor media bias, predict market mood, or power content recommendation engines by sentiment. It serves as an excellent starting point for projects involving news analytics or social listening.
