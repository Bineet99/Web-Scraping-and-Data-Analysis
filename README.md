## **Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis**

---

This project, developed during my internship at Navodita Infotech, is a complete Python-based tool that automates the process of web scraping, sentiment analysis, and data visualization from real-time news headlines.

The script scrapes the latest headlines from the Hindustan Times India News section using requests and BeautifulSoup. These headlines are then analyzed using TextBlob, an NLP library that determines the sentiment polarity of each news itemâ€”classifying them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The results are stored in a structured CSV file using pandas and visualized in a bar chart using matplotlib.

This project demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end data pipelinesâ€”from data extraction to insight generation. It showcases core skills in Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), data analysis, and visual reporting, making it a strong foundation for applications in media analytics, social listening, or public sentiment tracking.
