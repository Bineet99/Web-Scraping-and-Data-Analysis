## **Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis**

---

This project focuses on extracting live news headlines from the *Hindustan Times* website, analyzing their sentiment, and visualizing the results. Using Python, the script performs **web scraping** with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to gather headlines from the India News section. Each headline is then analyzed using `TextBlob` to determine its **sentiment polarity** — classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

The results are organized using `pandas` and saved as a CSV file. A **bar chart** generated with `matplotlib` visualizes the distribution of sentiments across the headlines. This provides a quick overview of the emotional tone of current news.

The project combines real-time data extraction, natural language processing (NLP), and basic data visualization — making it useful for news analytics, public opinion monitoring, or educational demos in Python.
